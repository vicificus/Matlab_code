function [data, samptime] = shiftedtime(data);  % If the sequence is shifted relative to zero. Ð¡ommonly used to process time sequences on oscilloscope.

function [bargraph, summary] = histOPA(data);  % Function for fast histogram processing (specialized for processing histograms of optical areas).

function [newattdata, dopattlevel] = attlevel(p_in, data);  % Determining the actual level of attenuation.

function error = abnpeaks(acf, lvlvalue) %Are there abnormal peaks on the autocorrelation function? Set at what delay they appear and find out their amplitude!
